              Minister of Gujarat and eventually the Prime Minister of India, Modi has left his mark

              entertaining journey!
            </p>

            <h3 class="heading-primary">Early Life and Education</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Narendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a Gujarati Hindu family of
              grocers in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was the
              third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi and Hiraben Modi. His family
              belonged to the Modh-Ghanchi-Teli (oil-presser) community.
              <br />
              <br />
              Modi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967, where he was
              described as an average student with a talent for debating and an interest in theatre.
              At the age of eight, he joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and attended its
              local shakhas, where he met influential figures like Lakshmanrao Inamdar and became a
              balswayamsevak (junior cadet).
              <br />
              <br />
              Narendra Modi's early education and career choices played a significant role in
              shaping his future. He was a curious and diligent student, always eager to learn.
              After completing his education, he delved into the world of politics, starting his
              journey towards becoming a prominent leader.
              <br />
              <br />
              In a traditional custom of his caste, Modi's family arranged a betrothal with
              Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, and they married when she was 17 and he was 18. However,
              shortly after their marriage, Modi left home, and the couple never divorced but lived
              separate lives. In the following years, Modi traveled across northern and
              north-eastern India, visiting Hindu ashrams and being influenced by Swami Vivekananda.
              He faced rejection at various ashrams due to his lack of college education.
              <br />
              <br />
              Modi's early life and education were the building blocks that laid the foundation for
              his long and eventful career. From Vadnagar's streets to the corridors of power, his
              journey was filled with twists and turns that shaped the man we know today. Stay tuned
              as we delve deeper into the fascinating life of Narendra Modi.
            </p>

            <h3 class="heading-primary">Early political career</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Narendra Modi's political career began during the state of emergency in India declared
              by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in June 1975. As a member of the Gujarat Lok Sangharsh
              Samiti, he actively opposed the Emergency, which led to his forced underground
              activities and involvement in organizing demonstrations and printing pamphlets against
              the government. Modi met influential political figures during this period. In 1978, he
              became an RSS regional organizer and later worked in Delhi researching and writing
              about the RSS's history during the Emergency.
              <br />
              <br />
              He returned to Gujarat in 1985 and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 1987,
              which stood for Hindu nationalism. His rise through the ranks was rapid, as he wisely
              chose mentors to further his career. He promoted privatization of businesses, small
              government and Hindu values. In 1995, Modi was elected BJP national secretary, a
              position from which he successfully helped settle internal leadership disputes, paving
              the way for BJP election victories in 1998.
            </p>
            <h3 class="heading-primary">Chief Minister of Gujarat</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Narendra Modi's tenure as the Chief Minister of Gujarat (2001-2014) marked a
              significant period of development and transformation for the state. Beginning on
              October 7, 2001, and continuing until May 22, 2014, Modi's leadership in Gujarat
              showcased his vision and dedication to driving progress and prosperity.
              <br />
              <br />
              Under Modi's stewardship, Gujarat experienced notable advancements in various sectors.
              His administration prioritized infrastructure development, attracting investments, and
              implementing policies to bolster industrial growth. Furthermore, Modi focused on
              enhancing the state's agricultural productivity, ensuring efficient irrigation
              facilities and promoting sustainable farming practices.
              <br />
              <br />
              During his tenure, Gujarat also witnessed several socio-economic reforms. Modi
              prioritized education, improving school infrastructure, and emphasizing skill
              development to empower the youth. His government launched initiatives to uplift
              marginalized communities, providing affordable housing, healthcare, and access to
              basic amenities.
              <br />
              <br />
              Modi's leadership in Gujarat laid the foundation for his subsequent role as the Prime
              Minister of India, a position he assumed on May 26, 2014. His tenure as Chief Minister
              remains significant, as it demonstrated his ability to drive development and implement
              transformative policies, setting a precedent for his future endeavors at the national
              level.
            </p>

            <h3 class="heading-primary">Elected as Prime Minister of India</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              In June 2013, Modi was selected to head the BJP’s 2014 election campaign to the Lok
              Sabha (the lower house of India’s parliament), while a grassroots campaign was already
              in place to elect him prime minister. Modi campaigned hard, portraying himself as a
              pragmatic candidate capable of turning around India’s economy, while his critics
              portrayed him as a controversial and divisive figure. In May 2014, he and his party
              were victorious, taking 282 of the 534 seats in the Lok Sabha. The victory marked a
              crushing defeat to the Indian National Congress, which had controlled country politics
              for most of the previous 60 years, and sent a message that India’s citizens were
              behind an agenda that moved away from a secular, socialist state to a more
              capitalist-leaning economy with Hindu nationalism at its core.
              <br />
              <br />
              On May 26, 2014 Modi was sworn in as the 14th prime minister of India and the first to
              have been born post-independence.
            </p>

            <h3 class="heading-primary">Policies Formation</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Since becoming prime minister, Modi has encouraged foreign businesses to invest in
              India. He has lifted various regulations - permits and inspections - so that
              businesses could grow more easily. He has decreased spending on social welfare
              programs and has encouraged the privatization of healthcare, although he has devised a
              policy on universal healthcare for those citizens with serious ailments. In 2014 he
              launched a "Clean India" campaign, which focused on sanitation and the construction of
              millions of toilets in rural areas.
              <br />
              <br />
              His environment policies have been lax, especially when those policies hamper
              industrial growth. He has lifted restrictions on protecting the environment and is
              more open to the use of genetically modified crops, despite protests from India's
              farmers. Under Modi's power, he has suppressed the influence of civil society
              organizations, such as Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, Avaaz, and other humanitarian
              groups, citing they prevent economic growth.
              <br />
              <br />
              In terms of foreign policy, Modi has taken on a multilateral approach. He has
              participated in the BRICS, ASEAN, and G20 summits, as well as aligned himself with the
              United States, China, Japan and Russia to improve economic and political ties. He has
              also reached out to Islamic republics, most notably fostering diplomatic ties with
              Pakistan, although he has repeatedly labeled the country a "terrorist state" and an
              "exporter of terrorism."
              <br />
              <br />
              Under his rule, Modi has substantially centralized his power compared to previous
              administrations.
            </p>

            <h3 class="heading-primary">Global Recognition and Influence</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              In 2016 Modi won the reader's poll as TIME's Person of the Year. In previous years, he
              had received top ranking as one of the most influential political figures in the world
              in both TIME and Forbes Magazine. He is only second to President Obama for having the
              most social media followers as a political figure. With high favorability ratings
              among Indian voters, Modi has a reputation for actively engaging citizens through
              social media and encouraging his own administration to stay active on its platforms.
              <br />
              <br />
              In addition, he demonstrated noteworthy leadership in handling the COVID-19 crisis.
              Amid the pandemic, Modi took decisive actions to mitigate the impact of the virus on
              the nation. Recognizing the severity of the situation, he implemented one of the
              world's largest and strictest lockdowns in March 2020, aiming to contain the spread of
              the virus. This decision showcased his commitment to prioritizing public health and
              safety. Furthermore, Modi actively engaged with citizens through social media,
              providing regular updates, sharing guidelines, and promoting preventive measures.
              <br />
              <br />
              Under his leadership, India made significant efforts to ramp up testing capacities and
              expand healthcare infrastructure to ensure adequate treatment for those affected by
              the virus. He also spearheaded initiatives to facilitate the production and
              distribution of vaccines, contributing to the global fight against COVID-19. Despite
              the challenges posed by the pandemic, his proactive measures and effective
              communication played a crucial role in guiding the nation through the crisis. His
              commitment to public welfare and dedication to addressing the pandemic's impact have
              solidified his reputation as a leader capable of navigating complex challenges.
